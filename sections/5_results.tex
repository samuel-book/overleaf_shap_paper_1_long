\section{Results}

\subsection{Variation in thrombolysis use}

Thrombolysis use in the original data varied between hospitals (figure \ref{fig:observed_thrombolysis}), from 1.5\% to 24.3\% of all patients, and 7.3\% to 49.7\% of patients arriving within 4 hours of known stroke onset.

\subsection{Feature selection}

In order to provide a more explainable machine learning model, the number of features were restricted to those that provide most information regarding use of thrombolysis. 25 features were selected by identifying one feature at a time that led to greatest improvement in Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Area Under Curve (AUC). ROC AUC was measured using stratified 5-fold cross validation.

The best model with 1, 2, 5, 10, 25 & all features (60 features before one-hot encoding of fields) had ROC AUCs of 0.715, 0.792, 0.891, 0.919, 0.923 & 0.922. We selected 10 features for all subsequent work, which were:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Arrival-to-scan time}: Time from arrival at hospital to scan (mins)
    \item \emph{Infarction}: Stroke type (1 = infarction, 0 = haemorrhage)
    \item \emph{Stroke severity}: Stroke severity (NIHSS) on arrival
    \item \emph{Precise onset time}: Onset time type (1 = precise, 0 = best estimate)
    \item \emph{Prior disability level}: Disability level (modified Rankin Scale) before stroke
    \item \emph{Stroke team}: Stroke team attended
    \item \emph{Use of AF anticoagulants}: Use of atrial fibrillation anticoagulant (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
    \item \emph{Onset-to-arrival time}: Time from onset of stroke to arrival at hospital (mins)
    \item \emph{Onset during sleep}: Did stroke occur in sleep?
    \item \emph{Age}: Age (as middle of 5 year age bands)
\end{itemize}

Correlations between the 10 features were measured using coefficients of determination (r-squared). All r-squared were less than 0.15, and all r-squared were less than 0.05 except 1) age and prior disability level (r-squared 0.146), and 2) onset during sleep and precise onset time (r-squared 0.078). All correlations are shown in table \ref{tab:correl}.

\caption{SHAP interaction between hospital ID for two teams and whether stroke onset time was known precisely. If a patient attended team HZNVT9936G then SHAP value for having a precise onset time was increased (a strengthening of the main effect of precise onset time). If a patient attended team FAJKD7118X then SHAP value for having a precise onset time was reduced (an attenuation of the main effect of precise onset time).}
