\caption{SHAP interaction between hospital ID for two teams and whether stroke onset time was known precisely. If a patient attended team HZNVT9936G then SHAP value for having a precise onset time was increased (a strengthening of the main effect of precise onset time). If a patient attended team FAJKD7118X then SHAP value for having a precise onset time was reduced (an attenuation of the main effect of precise onset time).}

\caption{A comparison of observed (actual) thrombolysis rate at each hospital and the predicted thrombolysis rate if decisions were made according to the majority vote of the 30 benchmark hospitals. The solid circle shows the current thrombolysis use, and the open circle shows the thrombolysis use predicted by a majority vote of the benchmark hospitals. The red points are those hospitals that are in the top 30 thrombolysing hospitals (the benchmark set) when 10k cohort thrombolysis use is predicted, with all other hospitals coloured blue.}
