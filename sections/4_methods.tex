\section{Methods}

\subsection{Data}

Data was obtained from the Sentinel Stroke National Audit (SSNAP\footnote{https://www.strokeaudit.org/}), managed through the Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership (HQIP\footnote{https://www.hqip.org.uk/}). SSNAP has near-complete coverage of all acute stroke admissions in the UK (outside Scotland). All hospitals admitting acute stroke participate in the audit, and year-on-year comparison with Hospital Episode Statistics\footnote{https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/data-tools-and-services/data-services/hospital-episode-statistics} confirms estimated case ascertainment of 95\% of coded cases of acute stroke.

The NHS Health Research Authority decision tool\footnote{http://www.hra-decisiontools.org.uk/research/} was used to confirm that ethical approval was not required to access the data. Data access was authorised by HQIP (reference HQIP303).

Data was retrieved for 246,676 emergency stroke admissions to acute stroke teams in England and Wales between 2016 and 2018 (three full years).

For calculation of Shapley values we used the Shap library \cite{lundberg_unified_2017}.
