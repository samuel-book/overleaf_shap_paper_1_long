	abstract = {PurposeBoth intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) and intra-arterial endovascular thrombectomy (ET) improve the outcome of patients with acute ischaemic stroke, with endovascular thrombectomy being an option for those patients with large vessel occlusions. We sought to understand how organisation of services affects time to treatment for both intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular thrombectomy.MethodA multi-objective optimisation approach was used to explore the relationship between the number of intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular thrombectomy centres and times to treatment. The analysis is based on 238,887 emergency stroke admissions in England over 3 years (2013–2015).ResultsProviding hyper-acute care only in comprehensive stroke centres (CSC, providing both intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular thrombectomy, and performing {\textgreater}150 endovascular thrombectomy per year, maximum 40 centres) in England would lead to 15\% of patients being more than 45 min away from care, and would create centres with up to 4300 stroke admissions/year. Mixing hyper-acute stroke units (providing intravenous thrombolysis only) with comprehensive stroke centres speeds time to intravenous thrombolysis and mitigates admission numbers to comprehensive stroke centres, but at the expense of increasing time to endovascular thrombectomy. With 24 comprehensive stroke centres and all remaining current acute stroke units as hyper-acute stroke units, redirecting patients directly to attend a comprehensive stroke centre by accepting a small delay (15-min maximum) in intravenous thrombolysis reduces time to endovascular thrombectomy: 25\% of all patients would be redirected from hyper-acute stroke units to a comprehensive stroke centre, with an average delay in intravenous thrombolysis of 8 min, and an average improvement in time to endovascular thrombectomy of 80 min. The balance of comprehensive stroke centre:hyper-acute stroke unit admissions would change from 24:76 to 49:51.ConclusionPlanning of hyper-acute stroke services is best achieved when considering all forms of acute care and ambulance protocol together. Times to treatment need to be considered alongside manageable and sustainable admission numbers.},

	abstract = {Objective To evaluate the application of clinical pathway simulation in machine learning, using clinical audit data, in order to identify key drivers for improving use and speed of thrombolysis at individual hospitals.
Design Computer simulation modelling and machine learning.
Setting Seven acute stroke units.
Participants Anonymised clinical audit data for 7864 patients.
Results Three factors were pivotal in governing thrombolysis use: (1) the proportion of patients with a known stroke onset time (range 44\%–73\%), (2) pathway speed (for patients arriving within 4 hours of onset: per-hospital median arrival-to-scan ranged from 11 to 56 min; median scan-to-thrombolysis ranged from 21 to 44 min) and (3) predisposition to use thrombolysis (thrombolysis use ranged from 31\% to 52\% for patients with stroke scanned with 30 min left to administer thrombolysis). A pathway simulation model could predict the potential benefit of improving individual stages of the clinical pathway speed, whereas a machine learning model could predict the benefit of ‘exporting’ clinical decision making from one hospital to another, while allowing for differences in patient population between hospitals. By applying pathway simulation and machine learning together, we found a realistic ceiling of 15\%–25\% use of thrombolysis across different hospitals and, in the seven hospitals studied, a realistic opportunity to double the number of patients with no significant disability that may be attributed to thrombolysis.
Conclusions National clinical audit may be enhanced by a combination of pathway simulation and machine learning, which best allows for an understanding of key levers for improvement in hyperacute stroke pathways, allowing for differences between local patient populations. These models, based on standard clinical audit data, may be applied at scale while providing results at individual hospital level. The models facilitate understanding of variation and levers for improvement in stroke pathways, and help set realistic targets tailored to local populations.},

	abstract = {Explaining complex or seemingly simple machine learning models is an important practical problem. We want to explain individual predictions from a complex machine learning model by learning simple, interpretable explanations. Shapley values is a game theoretic concept that can be used for this purpose. The Shapley value framework has a series of desirable theoretical properties, and can in principle handle any predictive model. Kernel SHAP is a computationally efficient approximation to Shapley values in higher dimensions. Like several other existing methods, this approach assumes that the features are independent, which may give very wrong explanations. This is the case even if a simple linear model is used for predictions. In this paper, we extend the Kernel SHAP method to handle dependent features. We provide several examples of linear and non-linear models with various degrees of feature dependence, where our method gives more accurate approximations to the true Shapley values. We also propose a method for aggregating individual Shapley values, such that the prediction can be explained by groups of dependent variables.},

	abstract = {Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction's accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.},

	abstract = {Background
Regularly updated data on stroke and its pathological types, including data on their incidence, prevalence, mortality, disability, risk factors, and epidemiological trends, are important for evidence-based stroke care planning and resource allocation. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) aims to provide a standardised and comprehensive measurement of these metrics at global, regional, and national levels.
Methods
We applied GBD 2019 analytical tools to calculate stroke incidence, prevalence, mortality, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and the population attributable fraction (PAF) of DALYs (with corresponding 95\% uncertainty intervals [UIs]) associated with 19 risk factors, for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2019. These estimates were provided for ischaemic stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage, subarachnoid haemorrhage, and all strokes combined, and stratified by sex, age group, and World Bank country income level.
Findings
In 2019, there were 12·2 million (95\% UI 11·0–13·6) incident cases of stroke, 101 million (93·2–111) prevalent cases of stroke, 143 million (133–153) DALYs due to stroke, and 6·55 million (6·00–7·02) deaths from stroke. Globally, stroke remained the second-leading cause of death (11·6\% [10·8–12·2] of total deaths) and the third-leading cause of death and disability combined (5·7\% [5·1–6·2] of total DALYs) in 2019. From 1990 to 2019, the absolute number of incident strokes increased by 70·0\% (67·0–73·0), prevalent strokes increased by 85·0\% (83·0–88·0), deaths from stroke increased by 43·0\% (31·0–55·0), and DALYs due to stroke increased by 32·0\% (22·0–42·0). During the same period, age-standardised rates of stroke incidence decreased by 17·0\% (15·0–18·0), mortality decreased by 36·0\% (31·0–42·0), prevalence decreased by 6·0\% (5·0–7·0), and DALYs decreased by 36·0\% (31·0–42·0). However, among people younger than 70 years, prevalence rates increased by 22·0\% (21·0–24·0) and incidence rates increased by 15·0\% (12·0–18·0). In 2019, the age-standardised stroke-related mortality rate was 3·6 (3·5–3·8) times higher in the World Bank low-income group than in the World Bank high-income group, and the age-standardised stroke-related DALY rate was 3·7 (3·5–3·9) times higher in the low-income group than the high-income group. Ischaemic stroke constituted 62·4\% of all incident strokes in 2019 (7·63 million [6·57–8·96]), while intracerebral haemorrhage constituted 27·9\% (3·41 million [2·97–3·91]) and subarachnoid haemorrhage constituted 9·7\% (1·18 million [1·01–1·39]). In 2019, the five leading risk factors for stroke were high systolic blood pressure (contributing to 79·6 million [67·7–90·8] DALYs or 55·5\% [48·2–62·0] of total stroke DALYs), high body-mass index (34·9 million [22·3–48·6] DALYs or 24·3\% [15·7–33·2]), high fasting plasma glucose (28·9 million [19·8–41·5] DALYs or 20·2\% [13·8–29·1]), ambient particulate matter pollution (28·7 million [23·4–33·4] DALYs or 20·1\% [16·6–23·0]), and smoking (25·3 million [22·6–28·2] DALYs or 17·6\% [16·4–19·0]).
Interpretation
The annual number of strokes and deaths due to stroke increased substantially from 1990 to 2019, despite substantial reductions in age-standardised rates, particularly among people older than 70 years. The highest age-standardised stroke-related mortality and DALY rates were in the World Bank low-income group. The fastest-growing risk factor for stroke between 1990 and 2019 was high body-mass index. Without urgent implementation of effective primary prevention strategies, the stroke burden will probably continue to grow across the world, particularly in low-income countries.

More importantly, we provide insights on cache access patterns, data compression and sharding to build a scalable tree boosting system. By combining these insights, XGBoost scales beyond billions of examples using far fewer resources than existing systems.},

	abstract = {Background Alteplase is effective for treatment of acute ischaemic stroke but debate continues about its use after longer times since stroke onset, in older patients, and among patients who have had the least or most severe strokes. We assessed the role of these factors in affecting good stroke outcome in patients given alteplase. Methods We did a pre-specified meta-analysis of individual patient data from 6756 patients in nine randomised trials comparing alteplase with placebo or open control. We included all completed randomised phase 3 trials of intravenous alteplase for treatment of acute ischaemic stroke for which data were available. Retrospective checks confirmed that no eligible trials had been omitted. We defined a good stroke outcome as no significant disability at 3-6 months, defined by a modified Rankin Score of 0 or 1. Additional outcomes included symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (defined by type 2 parenchymal haemorrhage within 7 days and, separately, by the SITS-MOST definition of parenchymal type 2 haemorrhage within 36 h), fatal intracranial haemorrhage within 7 days, and 90-day mortality. Findings Alteplase increased the odds of a good stroke outcome, with earlier treatment associated with bigger proportional benefit. Treatment within 3·0 h resulted in a good outcome for 259 (32·9\%) of 787 patients who received alteplase versus 176 (23·1\%) of 762 who received control (OR 1·75, 95\% CI 1·35-2·27); delay of greater than 3·0 h, up to 4·5 h, resulted in good outcome for 485 (35·3\%) of 1375 versus 432 (30·1\%) of 1437 (OR 1·26, 95\% CI 1·05-1·51); and delay of more than 4·5 h resulted in good outcome for 401 (32·6\%) of 1229 versus 357 (30·6\%) of 1166 (OR 1·15, 95\% CI 0·95-1·40). Proportional treatment benefits were similar irrespective of age or stroke severity. Alteplase significantly increased the odds of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (type 2 parenchymal haemorrhage definition 231 [6·8\%] of 3391 vs 44 [1·3\%] of 3365, OR 5·55, 95\% CI 4·01-7·70, p{\textbackslash}textless0·0001; SITS-MOST definition 124 [3·7\%] vs 19 [0·6\%], OR 6·67, 95\% CI 4·11-10·84, p{\textbackslash}textless0·0001) and of fatal intracranial haemorrhage within 7 days (91 [2·7\%] vs 13 [0·4\%]; OR 7·14, 95\% CI 3·98-12·79, p{\textbackslash}textless0·0001). The relative increase in fatal intracranial haemorrhage from alteplase was similar irrespective of treatment delay, age, or stroke severity, but the absolute excess risk attributable to alteplase was bigger among patients who had more severe strokes. There was no excess in other early causes of death and no significant effect on later causes of death. Consequently, mortality at 90 days was 608 (17·9\%) in the alteplase group versus 556 (16·5\%) in the control group (hazard ratio 1·11, 95\% CI 0·99-1·25, p=0·07). Taken together, therefore, despite an average absolute increased risk of early death from intracranial haemorrhage of about 2\%, by 3-6 months this risk was offset by an average absolute increase in disability-free survival of about 10\% for patients treated within 3·0 h and about 5\% for patients treated after 3·0 h, up to 4·5 h. Interpretation Irrespective of age or stroke severity, and despite an increased risk of fatal intracranial haemorrhage during the first few days after treatment, alteplase significantly improves the overall odds of a good stroke outcome when delivered within 4·5 h of stroke onset, with earlier treatment associated with bigger proportional benefits.

	abstract = {Introduction
Acute stroke unit care, intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular treatment significantly improve the outcome for patients with ischaemic stroke, but data on access and delivery throughout Europe are lacking. We assessed best available data on access and delivery of acute stroke unit care, intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular treatment throughout Europe.

Methods
A survey, drafted by stroke professionals (ESO, ESMINT, EAN) and a patient organisation (SAFE), was sent to national stroke societies and experts in 51 European countries (World Health Organization definition) requesting experts to provide national data on stroke unit, intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular treatment rates. We compared both pooled and individual national data per one million inhabitants and per 1000 annual incident ischaemic strokes with highest country rates. Population estimates were based on United Nations data, stroke incidences on the Global Burden of Disease Report.

Results
We obtained data from 44 European countries. The estimated mean number of stroke units was 2.9 per million inhabitants (95\% CI 2.3–3.6) and 1.5 per 1000 annual incident strokes (95\% CI 1.1–1.9), highest country rates were 9.2 and 5.8. Intravenous thrombolysis was provided in 42/44 countries. The estimated mean annual number of intravenous thrombolysis was 142.0 per million inhabitants (95\% CI 107.4–176.7) and 72.7 per 1000 annual incident strokes (95\% CI 54.2–91.2), highest country rates were 412.2 and 205.5. Endovascular treatment was provided in 40/44 countries. The estimated mean annual number of endovascular treatments was 37.1 per million inhabitants (95\% CI 26.7–47.5) and 19.3 per 1000 annual incident strokes (95\% CI 13.5–25.1), highest country rates were 111.5 and 55.9. Overall, 7.3\% of incident ischaemic stroke patients received intravenous thrombolysis (95\% CI 5.4–9.1) and 1.9\% received endovascular treatment (95\% CI 1.3–2.5), highest country rates were 20.6\% and 5.6\%.

Conclusion
We observed major inequalities in acute stroke treatment between and within 44 European countries. Our data will assist decision makers implementing tailored stroke care programmes for reducing stroke-related morbidity and mortality in Europe.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Today, treatment of acute stroke consists of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), admission to a stroke unit, and aspirin. Although tPA treatment is the most effective, there is substantial undertreatment. Centralized care may affect rate, timing, and outcome of thrombolysis compared to decentralized treatment in community hospitals. The present study aimed to assess the impact of organizational models on the proportion of patients undergoing tPA treatment.
METHODS: A prospective, multicenter, observational study among 13 hospitals in the North of the Netherlands was conducted. In the centralized model, tPA treatment for 4 hospitals was administered in 1 stroke center. The decentralized model comprised 9 community hospitals. Primary outcome was the proportion of patients treated with tPA. Secondary outcome measures were proportion of patients arriving within 4.5 hours, safety, 90-day functional outcome, and onset-to-door, door-to-needle, and onset-to-needle times. Potential confounders were adjusted using logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: Two hundred eighty-three and 801 ischemic stroke patients were enrolled in the centralized and decentralized settings. Numbers of patients treated with tPA were 62 (21.9\%) and 113 (14.1\%) (OR, 1.72; 95\% CI, 1.22-2.43). Adjusting for potential confounders did not alter results (OR, 2.03; 95\% CI, 1.39-2.96). In the centralized setting, significantly more patients arrived at the hospital within the 4.5-hour time window (P{\textless}0.01), and shorter door-to-needle times were reached (35 versus 47 minutes). Other secondary outcome measures did not differ across setting.
CONCLUSIONS: In a centralized setting, the results demonstrate a 50\% increased likelihood of treatment. Prehospital factors seem to contribute to this result.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In July 2010 a new multiple hub-and-spoke model for acute stroke care was implemented across the whole of London, UK, with continuous specialist care during the first 72 hours provided at 8 hyper-acute stroke units (HASUs) compared to the previous model of 30 local hospitals receiving acute stroke patients. We investigated differences in clinical outcomes and costs between the new and old models.
METHODS: We compared outcomes and costs 'before' (July 2007-July 2008) vs. 'after' (July 2010-June 2011) the introduction of the new model, adjusted for patient characteristics and national time trends in mortality and length of stay. We constructed 90-day and 10-year decision analytic models using data from population based stroke registers, audits and published sources. Mortality and length of stay were modelled using survival analysis.
FINDINGS: In a pooled sample of 307 patients 'before' and 3156 patients 'after', survival improved in the 'after' period (age adjusted hazard ratio 0.54; 95\% CI 0.41-0.72). The predicted survival rates at 90 days in the deterministic model adjusted for national trends were 87.2\% 'before' \% (95\% CI 86.7\%-87.7\%) and 88.7\% 'after' (95\% CI 88.6\%-88.8\%); a relative reduction in deaths of 12\% (95\% CI 8\%-16\%). Based on a cohort of 6,438 stroke patients, the model produces a total cost saving of £5.2 million per year at 90 days (95\% CI £4.9-£5.5 million; £811 per patient).
CONCLUSION: A centralized model for acute stroke care across an entire metropolitan city appears to have reduced mortality for a reduced cost per patient, predominately as a result of reduced hospital length of stay.},

Mixed logit regression analyses were conducted on the data.ResultsA total of 138 clinicians completed the discrete choice experiment. Seven patient factors were individually predictive of increased likelihood of immediately offering IV alteplase (compared to reference levels in brackets): stroke onset time 2?h 30?min [50 min]; pre-stroke dependency mRS 3 [mRS 4]; systolic blood pressure 185?mm/Hg [140 mm/Hg]; stroke severity scores of NIHSS 5 without aphasia, NIHSS 14 and NIHSS 23 [NIHSS 2 without aphasia]; age 85 [68]; Afro-Caribbean [white]. Factors predictive of withholding treatment with IV alteplase were: age 95 [68]; stroke onset time of 4?h 15?min [50 min]; severe dementia [no memory problems]; SBP 200?mm/Hg [140 mm/Hg]. Three clinician-related factors were predictive of an increased likelihood of offering IV alteplase (perceived robustness of the evidence for IV alteplase; thrombolyzing more patients in the past 12 months; and high discomfort with uncertainty) and one with a decreased likelihood (high clinician comfort with treating patients outside the licensing criteria).ConclusionsBoth patient- and clinician-related factors have a major influence on the use of alteplase to treat patients with acute ischemic stroke. Clinicians? views of the evidence, comfort with uncertainty and treating patients outside the license criteria are important factors to address in programs that seek to reduce variation in care quality regarding treatment with IV alteplase.

	abstract = {Background Stroke is a common cause of adult disability. Expert opinion is that about 20\% of patients should receive thrombolysis to break up a clot causing the stroke. Currently, 11–12\% of patients in England and Wales receive this treatment, ranging between 2\% and 24\% between hospitals. Objectives We sought to enhance the national stroke audit by providing further analysis of the key sources of inter-hospital variation to determine how a target of 20\% of stroke patients receiving thrombolysis may be reached. Design We modelled three aspects of the thrombolysis pathway, using machine learning and clinical pathway simulation. In addition, the project had a qualitative research arm, with the objective of understanding clinicians’ attitudes to use of modelling and machine learning applied to the national stroke audit. Participants and data source Anonymised data were collected for 246,676 emergency stroke admissions to acute stroke teams in England and Wales between 2016 and 2018, obtained from the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme. Results Use of thrombolysis could be predicted with 85\% accuracy for those patients with a chance of receiving thrombolysis (i.e. those arriving within 4 hours of stroke onset). Machine learning models allowed prediction of likely treatment choice for each patient at all hospitals. A clinical pathway simulation predicted hospital thrombolysis use with an average absolute error of 0.5 percentage points. We found that about half of the inter-hospital variation in thrombolysis use came from differences in local patient populations, and half from in-hospital processes and decision-making. Three changes were applied to all hospitals in the model: (1) arrival to treatment in 30 minutes, (2) proportion of patients with determined stroke onset times set to at least the national upper quartile and (3) thrombolysis decisions made based on majority vote of a benchmark set of 30 hospitals. Any single change alone was predicted to increase national thrombolysis use from 11.6\% to between 12.3\% and 14.5\% (with clinical decision-making having the most effect). Combined, these changes would be expected to increase thrombolysis to 18.3\% (and to double the clinical benefit of thrombolysis, as speed increases also improve clinical benefit independently of the proportion of patients receiving thrombolysis); however, there would still be significant variation between hospitals depending on local patient population. For each hospital, the effect of each change could be predicted alone or in combination. Qualitative research with 19 clinicians showed that engagement with, and trust in, the model was greatest in physicians from units with higher thrombolysis rates. Physicians also wanted to see a machine learning model predicting outcome with probability of adverse effect of thrombolysis to counter a fear that driving thrombolysis use up may cause more harm than good. Limitations Models may be built using data available in the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme only. Not all factors affecting use of thrombolysis are contained in Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme data and the model, therefore, provides information on patterns of thrombolysis use in hospitals, but is not suitable for, or intended as, a decision aid to thrombolysis. Conclusions Machine learning and clinical pathway simulation may be applied at scale to national audit data, allowing extended use and analysis of audit data. Stroke thrombolysis rates of at least 18\% look achievable in England and Wales, but each hospital should have its own target. Future work Future studies should extend machine learning modelling to predict the patient-level outcome and probability of adverse effects of thrombolysis, and apply co-production techniques, with clinicians and other stakeholders, to communicate model outputs.

	abstract = {Background:

Expert opinion is that about 20\% of emergency stroke patients should receive thrombolysis. Currently, 11\% to 12\% of patients in England and Wales receive thrombolysis, ranging from 2\% to 24\% between hospitals. The aim of this study was to assess how much variation is due to differences in local patient populations, and how much is due to differences in clinical decision-making and stroke pathway performance, while estimating a realistic target thrombolysis use.

Methods:

Anonymised data for 246 676 emergency stroke admissions to 132 acute hospitals in England and Wales between 2016 and 2018 was obtained from the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme data. We used machine learning to learn decisions on who to give thrombolysis to at each hospital. We used clinical pathway simulation to model effects of changing pathway performance. Qualitative research was used to assess clinician attitudes to these methods. Three changes were modeled: (1) arrival-to-treatment in 30 minutes, (2) proportion of patients with determined stroke onset times set to at least the national upper quartile, (3) thrombolysis decisions made based on majority vote of a benchmark set of hospitals.

Results:

Of the modeled changes, any single change was predicted to increase national thrombolysis use from 11.6\% to between 12.3\% to 14.5\% (clinical decision-making having the most effect). Combined, these changes would be expected to increase thrombolysis to 18.3\%, but there would still be significant variation between hospitals depending on local patient population. Clinicians engaged well with the modeling, but those from hospitals with lower thrombolysis use were most cautious about the methods.

Conclusions:

Machine learning and clinical pathway simulation may be applied at scale to national stroke audit data, allowing extended use and analysis of audit data. Stroke thrombolysis rates of at least 18\% look achievable in England and Wales, but each hospital should have its own target.},

	abstract = {Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

	abstract = {Background Audit and feedback (A\&F) is a valuable quality improvement strategy, which can contribute to de-implementation of low-value care. In the Netherlands, all health insurers collaboratively provide A\&F to general practitioners (GPs), the ‘Primary Care Practice Report’ (PCPR). Unfortunately, the use of this report by GPs is limited. This study examined the thoughts of GPs on the usability of the PCPR and GPs recommendations for improving the PCPR.
Method We used an interpretative qualitative design, with think-aloud tasks to uncover thoughts of GPs on the usability of the PCPR and semistructured interview questions to ask GPs’ recommendations for improvement of the PCPR. Interviews were audiorecorded and transcribed ad verbatim. Data were analysed using thematic content analysis.
Results We identified two main themes: ‘poor usability of the PCPR’, and ‘minimal motivation to change based on the PCPR’. The GPs found the usability of the PCPR poor due to the feedback not being clinically meaningful, the data not being recent, individual and reliable, the performance comparators offer insufficient guidance to assess clinical performance, the results are not discussed with peers and the definitions and visuals are unclear. The GPs recommended improving these issues. The GPs motivation to change based on the PCPR was minimal.
Conclusions The GPs evaluated the PCPR as poorly usable and were minimally motivated to change. The PCPR seems developed from the perspective of the reports’ commissioners, health insurers, and does not meet known criteria for effective A\&F design and user-centred design. Importantly, the GPs did state that well-designed feedback could contribute to their motivation to improve clinical performance.Furthermore, the GPs stated that they receive a multitude of A\&F reports, which they hardly use. Thus, we see a need for policy makers to invest in less, but more usable A\&F reports.},

	shorttitle = {Audit and feedback},
	doi = {10.1002/14651858.CD000259.pub3},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Audit and feedback is widely used as a strategy to improve professional practice either on its own or as a component of multifaceted quality improvement interventions. This is based on the belief that healthcare professionals are prompted to modify their practice when given performance feedback showing that their clinical practice is inconsistent with a desirable target. Despite its prevalence as a quality improvement strategy, there remains uncertainty regarding both the effectiveness of audit and feedback in improving healthcare practice and the characteristics of audit and feedback that lead to greater impact.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of audit and feedback on the practice of healthcare professionals and patient outcomes and to examine factors that may explain variation in the effectiveness of audit and feedback.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) 2010, Issue 4, part of The Cochrane Library. www.thecochranelibrary.com, including the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group Specialised Register (searched 10 December 2010); MEDLINE, Ovid (1950 to November Week 3 2010) (searched 09 December 2010); EMBASE, Ovid (1980 to 2010 Week 48) (searched 09 December 2010); CINAHL, Ebsco (1981 to present) (searched 10 December 2010); Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index, ISI Web of Science (1975 to present) (searched 12-15 September 2011).
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials of audit and feedback (defined as a summary of clinical performance over a specified period of time) that reported objectively measured health professional practice or patient outcomes. In the case of multifaceted interventions, only trials in which audit and feedback was considered the core, essential aspect of at least one intervention arm were included.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: All data were abstracted by two independent review authors. For the primary outcome(s) in each study, we calculated the median absolute risk difference (RD) (adjusted for baseline performance) of compliance with desired practice compliance for dichotomous outcomes and the median percent change relative to the control group for continuous outcomes. Across studies the median effect size was weighted by number of health professionals involved in each study. We investigated the following factors as possible explanations for the variation in the effectiveness of interventions across comparisons: format of feedback, source of feedback, frequency of feedback, instructions for improvement, direction of change required, baseline performance, profession of recipient, and risk of bias within the trial itself. We also conducted exploratory analyses to assess the role of context and the targeted clinical behaviour. Quantitative (meta-regression), visual, and qualitative analyses were undertaken to examine variation in effect size related to these factors.
MAIN RESULTS: We included and analysed 140 studies for this review. In the main analyses, a total of 108 comparisons from 70 studies compared any intervention in which audit and feedback was a core, essential component to usual care and evaluated effects on professional practice. After excluding studies at high risk of bias, there were 82 comparisons from 49 studies featuring dichotomous outcomes, and the weighted median adjusted RD was a 4.3\% (interquartile range (IQR) 0.5\% to 16\%) absolute increase in healthcare professionals' compliance with desired practice. Across 26 comparisons from 21 studies with continuous outcomes, the weighted median adjusted percent change relative to control was 1.3\% (IQR = 1.3\% to 28.9\%). For patient outcomes, the weighted median RD was -0.4\% (IQR -1.3\% to 1.6\%) for 12 comparisons from six studies reporting dichotomous outcomes and the weighted median percentage change was 17\% (IQR 1.5\% to 17\%) for eight comparisons from five studies reporting continuous outcomes. Multivariable meta-regression indicated that feedback may be more effective when baseline performance is low, the source is a supervisor or colleague, it is provided more than once, it is delivered in both verbal and written formats, and when it includes both explicit targets and an action plan. In addition, the effect size varied based on the clinical behaviour targeted by the intervention.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Audit and feedback generally leads to small but potentially important improvements in professional practice. The effectiveness of audit and feedback seems to depend on baseline performance and how the feedback is provided. Future studies of audit and feedback should directly compare different ways of providing feedback.},
